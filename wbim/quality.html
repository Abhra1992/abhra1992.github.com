    <h4>Assignment 3 - Information and Data Quality</h4>
    <article>
      <h5>Top 10 Criteria for Quality of Information on the Web</h5>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the following criteria are the top 10 (in order of importance) for determining 
        the quality of information on the Web. Note: Many criteria are combined because I lay equal importance
        on the qualities being present simultaneously.
      </p>
      <ul class="quality-criteria">
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Availability + Accessibility + Openness</h6>
          <p>To be of value, the information should be actually available and accessible. Not all data are available
          on-line, and the information should be easily retrievable when it is needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Authority + Provenance + Verifiability</h6>
          <p>The information should indicate its source, that depicts the expertise or reputation of its provider.
          The validity of the information should be verifiable irrespective of how authoritative the source is.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Accuracy</h6>
          <p>The information should be correct, and should cite sources as support for evidence.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Objectivity + Validity</h6>
          <p>The information should not be biased towards a particular object or community, and should provide a fair
          interpretation of facts. The representation should be valid across all uses of the information.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Concise Representation + Composition</h6>
          <p>The information should be clear, compact and unambiguous, and the message should have and presented 
          in a coherent, logically sequential manner.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Timeliness + Currency</h6>
          <p>The information should indicate over what period the data was collected, when were the data last updated,
          and how long the data is likely to remain current and valid.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Scope of Coverage + Relevancy</h6>
          <p>The information should explore a topic over a reasonable extent to be useful. Incomplete analysis often
          degrades quality. Information should not relate to something for which it wasn't intended.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Completeness + Documentation</h6>
          <p>All eligible data should be considered for compiling the information, and instructions should be provided
          as to how to interpret individual pieces of information.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Reliability + Reputation</h6>
          <p>Users of the information should be able to rely on it for their tasks, and it should not stand invalidated
          in any particular case. It should also indicate its usefulness int he form of user reviews.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="criterion">
          <h6>Usability + Interpretability + Reproducibility</h6>
          <p>Last of all, the information should be able to be interpreted and analysed, to be put into use. It should
          also be capable of achieving a consistent result in all uses.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Comparison of Quality Models and Frameworks</h5>
      <p>
        The following is a comparison of 3 information quality models, and an attempt
        to determine the best of them.
      </p>
      <ul class="framework-details">
        <li class="framework">
          <p>
            <u>Dedeke's Conceptual Framework</u> (2000) lays emphasis on 5 quality categories, and has 28 dimensions.
            The premise of the paper is that the quality of IS cannot be or at least should not be considered in
            isolation of the data quality, work attributes and the processes involved during the utilization of data.
            The paper presents a hierarchical quality framework for IS. It can be summarised as below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One needs to clearly define what IS quality means to an organization.</li>
            <li>One needs to develop dimensions for the categories of quality identified.</li>
            <li>Data quality measures cannot be developed in isolation of the processes of data generation and the
            contexts in which data is utilized.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Significant amongst the considered qualities are Ergonomic, Accessibility, Transactional,
            Contextual and Representation. The quality classification is intricately detailed, but is also limited
            in scope. It focuses only on data, work and Software/Hardware issues. It does not include issues like 
            cultural or behavioral issues.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="framework">
          <p>
            <u>Naumann & Rolker's Classification of IQ Metadata Criteria</u> (2000) is unapparently quite complex, using
            a 3-fold assessment for the quality of an information source, according to the subjects, objects
            and processes involved in Information Retrieval. The framework accounts for 22 criteria for assessing IQ.
            The premise of this model is based on two basic assumptions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The quality of information is influenced by the perception of the user, the information itself,
            and the process of accessing the information</li>
            <li>The information retrieval process involves the user, the information and the retrieval system.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Both the influences and the processes involved with Information Quality and Retrieval are used to 
            assign quality scores within three contexts, Subject, Process or Object criteria.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="framework">
          <p>
            <u>Leung's Adapted Extended ISO Model for Intranets</u> (2001) is an adaptation of Zeist & Hendriks Extended
            ISO Model (1996), applied to Intranet environments, based on 6 quality characteristics. It concentrates on the
            user-application process in order to develop a method to assess quality. The focus specifically concerns an
            Intranet environment. However, many of the governing principals and decision making processes outlined are
            useful when developing a way to assess the quality of information on Internet Web Pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leung suggests that any metric initiative must address the needs of its potential users and should be
            objective, cost effective and informative. These suggestions can be summarised as below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify the user</li>
            <li>Identify the metric applications (and processes that make up the system)</li>
            <li>Identify the dimensions to be assessed</li>
            <li>Prioritise the dimensions on Importance, Urgency and Cost metrics</li>
            <li>Develop specific assessment metrics for prioritised dimensions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was suprised to observe that two of the frameworks I considered in the comparison were also amongst the ones
        evaluated by <i>Knight & Burn</i> (2005). As a result, I also incorporated some of their findings in my comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the above discussion, I find Naumann and Rolker's framework to be the most succint, easy to use,
        and complete representation of what I value most in Information Quality. As a result, for personal uses,
        I would prefer to use this framework over others.
