    The biggest incident of Social Engineering in the history of IIT Mandi

Facbook Account (Logged-In) in Chrome
  We posted crap, just out of fun
  Logged Out, so that he doesn't realise or suspect anything when he comes back
    We now don't know the password, we'll come back to this later
Sachin enters room
  has an exam in 30 minutes, studies and goes away
  friends make fun of him in the corridor, but he has an exam, doen't have time to undo the crap we posted
  we have about 2 hours with us for exploring more avenues for pranks
Sachin in the exam hall
  we opened chrome
  knew his fb email -> first application of social engineering
  searched chrome for saved fb password - did not find - but found saved linkedin password
  tried entering his linkedin password in facebook - cannot log in
  facebook asks -> forgot ur password? - asks for contact email id / phone
  scrap this idea as we didnt want him to receive notifications over sms, and we didnt have access to his mail either
  select the option - we don't have access to any of these
  fb asks for phone number or email which u can access - enter my phone number
  tried fb's facility of contacting trusted friends
  tried entering two of our accounts - failed, as we reside in the same region - fb account protected due to its graph properties
  we now tried taking control over his gmail to recover his fb account
Gmail control
  we knew his gmail id
  looked for autofill in chrome and firefox - failed
  tried linkedin password - turned out to be wrong
  Google asks -> Your password was changed 9 months ago. Did you not change your password?
  exploit this fact - say no, i didn't
  to reset the link google had to send a text to his phone number, or email to recovery account of yahoo - another trap
  we don't know yahoo account id either
  select the option - we don't have access to any of these
  Google asks for first ever used phone number - skip this question
  Google asks for new recovery id and phone number - gave my phone number and email id
  Google asks security question - skip it again
  Google asks for 5 recently used contacts from address book
  gave 4 aliases to my email account - and the phone number of my second phone
  Google asks - list upto 4 google products you use and when you started using them
  We chose the following 3 options -> another 3 instances of social engineering
  android - we knew he recently bought an android phone 3 months ago
  gmail & gtalk - he created his google account when he joined IIT Mandi, we know this since he's my roommate
  Finally Google is happy, and sends the password reset link to my email address
I open my email
  i have sachin's password recovery link for google account
  enter his charger's manufacturer 'nakodacomputer' as the password
  so that we have a written sample of the password and don't forget it ourselves
  after password is reset, login to google account
  change his recovery email id from yahoo to my email
  i'll keep receiving future notifications to recovering his account - more on this later
Log in to Fb
  use facebook's forgot password link
  log in with google openid
  add ourselves as his strusted contacts - a backdoor for future attacks
  remove his phone number
As i write this, i received an email from google recovery that sachin has changed his google account password
  The war has begun :D
